          What We Consider “Personal Information”
        </p>
        <p className="leading-8 opacity-70">
          We follow EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) which
          defines personal data as: “…any information relating to an identified
          or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable
          natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly,
          in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an
          identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one
          or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic,
          mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person”.
          When we use terms “personal data" or “personal information”, we mean
          exactly that.

          Safeguarding Measures

        <p className="leading-8 opacity-70">
          As stated in our keynote, your privacy is the highest concern for us.
          We make every possible effort to protect you and your Personal Data
          from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction. We
          implement and maintain the following technical and security measures:
          System Access Controls: We take reasonable measures to prevent
          Personal Data from being used without authorization. These controls
          shall vary based on the nature of the processing undertaken and may
          include, among other controls, authentication via passwords and/or
          two-factor authentication, documented authorization processes,
          documented change management processes and/or logging of access on
          several levels. Data Access Controls: We take reasonable measures to
          ensure that Personal Data is accessible and manageable only by
          properly authorized staff. Direct database query access is restricted
          and application access rights are established and enforced to ensure
          that persons entitled to use a data processing system only have access
          to the Personal Data to which they have privilege of access; and that
          personal data cannot be read, copied, modified or removed without
          authorization in the course of processing. Storing Data in a Data
          Center: personal information is stored in a data center located in
          Frankfurt. This is secure: the data center does not demand that we
          collect any data about your traffic or your use of our products and
          services. If they request us to start doing so, we will stop working
          with this provider and find an alternative. Transmission Controls: We
          take reasonable measures to ensure that it is possible to check and
          establish to which entities the transfer of personal data by means of
          data transmission facilities is envisaged so personal data cannot be
          read, copied, modified or removed without authorization during
          electronic transmission or transport. Input Controls: We take
          reasonable measures to make it possible to check and establish whether
          and by whom personal data has been entered into data processing
          systems, modified or removed. Data Backup: Back-ups of the databases
          are made on a regular basis, are secured, and encrypted to ensure that
          personal data is protected against accidental destruction or loss when
          hosted by us. Logical Separation: Personal Data is logically
          segregated on our systems to ensure that Personal Data that is
          collected for different purposes can be processed separately.
